# Welcome to the Next Stage in the Geomining Revolution
<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix" src="/docs/assets/matrix_horizontal.svg">
</h1>
**XYO** Is excited to announce two new products that will allow you to fully immerse yourself in the XYO network and become fully participatory in the process of Geomining and of ensuring strong location data certainty across many use cases and applications. 

Our **new XYO App** allows you to easily connect to both the new Sentinel X and the Bridge X to accelerate your geomining workflow. The interface is easy to use and it is a great tool to monitor number of Bound Witnesses, connect devices to the Xyo network and access tutorials on your devices.

We are also thrilled to introduce you to The **Matrix**, a new member of the XYO family which allows you to easily connect to a diviner. The **Matrix** is also a visual tool of the XYO network, where you can see activity in real time. The geomining revolution continues!

## Tools for Sentinels, Bridges, and Archivists

## Using the App
**The New XYO App allows you to interact with the XYO network's Sentinels and Bridges. In order to start interacting with the App you will need a few tools**

## Connecting your Bridge X with a browser

**The XYO Bridge is the primary data relayer of the XYO Network. It signs off on collected data from nearby Sentinel X devices to add to the proof of origin chain.**

### Getting Started

### What will you need? Some of these items you may not need but you should have just in case. 

- Bridge X device
- [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- Access to router information 
- Ethernet cable
- HDMI Cable 

## Key Concepts you should review before diving into set up with the App

We recommend that you review these items prior to starting, but if you are too excited to get right in, go ahead and continue and these resources will be here when and if you need to dig deeper into a key word or concept. 

- [Read this guide on the 4 Node Types of XYO](https://developers.xyo.network/docs/en/Introduction/)
- [Read on the concept of a smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Smart_contracts)

### Getting connected 

### Set up  

To start using the Bridge X, you will need the device, and as back up, an ethernet cable and/or an HDMI cable.

- Set up the Bridge X near your internet router if possible for maximum effectiveness
- Connect the Bridge X to a power outlet
- Visit **app.xyo.network**
- Click **Sign In**
- You will now see the new XYO App Dashboard
- Click **Devices** which is in the main navigation bar next to **Bound Witnesses**
- With the XYO App you can connect to a sentinel or a bridge. Scroll down the dashboard
- Click **Connect More Bridges** 
- A modal interface with the Bridge will appear with your IP information and a request to pair like so: 
**INSERT MODAL IMAGE HERE**
- You may notice possible bluetooth devices appear in the modal that are **unknown or unsupported devices** these devices are not bridges, and most likely your smart phone, smart watch, or other bluetooth enabled device
- When you do have a bridge connected, you will notice it immediately as a supported device
- Through the Bridge interface you confirm your bridge and then update your archivist and wifi

### Using the XYO app to get data for your Bridge X

**Dashboard image here**

### Additional notes on the Bridge X

- Make sure you check the XYO app ocassionally to confirm that your bridge is still active and gathering heuristics from nearby Sentinel X devices.
- 

### Using the Matrix

- You should also check out the Matrix for more info on the Archivists and Diviners that are using the date that your Bridge X is relaying. 

**place Matrix dashboard view here*


**You have just executed one of the core essentials of the XYO Network and the Matrix, celebrate by going to our [Matrix Guide]() to learn more about the Matrix and setting up your archivist to gather heuristics from your bridge, and if you really want to dive deep, go to our [Developer Portal]()

### Congratulations you have continued your journey into XYO and Bridge X!

## Tools for Diviners

## Using the Matrix

**Along with serving as a viewer as to the state of the XYO network, the New XYO Matrix allows you to interact with Archivists and Diviners. In order to start interacting with the Matrix you will need a few tools**

### Getting Started

### What will you need?  

- Your chosen MetaMask tool - MetaMask allows you to use Ethereum accounts to interact with dApps

  - [MetaMask - Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)
  - [MetaMask - Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/)
  - [MetaMask - Opera Add-on](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/metamask/)
  - [Metamask using the Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)
    - **note** Using the Brave Browser is similar to using the Google Chrome version
  - A [GitHub account](https://github.com)
    - **note** If you do not have one, you can sign up using the link above

- A Faucet with XYO tokens
- And the [XYO Matrix]()

## Key Concepts and notices you should review before diving into the Matrix

We recommend that you review these items prior to starting, but if you are too excited to get right in, go ahead and continue and these resources will be here when and if you need to dig deeper into a key word or concept. 

- [Read this guide on the 4 Node Types of XYO](https://developers.xyo.network/docs/en/Introduction/)
- [Read on the concept of a smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Smart_contracts)

**NOTE** This is a tool that is still in continuous development using Ethereum on a testnet, **there will be some latency in certain processes**, so please ensure that you reserve a fair amount of time without too much interruption for this setup and walkthrough. 

**NOTE** Also, all of the Eth and XYO that you will be using for this walkthrough does not have any value, this is utility currency that is being used to power your interactions with the Matrix and for setup for future mainnet events.

## Set up  

To start using the Matrix, you will need to set up your MetaMask for the accounts that you have that contain XYO.

If you do not currently have a wallet, click on the **create wallet** in the **New to MetaMask?** screen

If you clicked on one of the above MetaMask links, that should've started you on the installation and setup of your MetaMask, including your seed phrase (see below).

Once you have setup your MetaMask, you will be directed to the main dashboard

**This Dashboard includes:** 
- Your primary account number 
- How much **eth** and **XYO** you have in the account 
  - This will vary depending on which network you are in - to use the Matrix in this Beta State, you will use the ***Kovan Test Network***
- Transaction History
- Deposit/Send buttons
- A Network Selector in the upper right hand side of the dashboard
  - Again, to use the Matrix in this state, you will need to select the ***Kovan Test Network***

### Connecting Your Wallet

- It's time to go into the Matrix
- Click on **Connect Wallet** on the main Matrix Dashboard
  - After clicking you will see that MetaMask will pop-up again to prompt you to confirm that *XYO Matrix* can connect to your account
- After MetaMask confirmation the Matrix will be updated with your XYO token balance and address

**Once you have MetaMask setup and have connected your wallet you will be able to go to `Network Requests`, then `create request`, which will prompt the Matrix to direct you to our Kovan faucet so you can receive XYO Tokens**

## Using the Request/Response Interface

The XYO Network runs on making requests and getting responses. This query/answer protocol is what fuels the conversations between XYO nodes, and what allows us to reach location data certainty.

Using the Matrix, we can initiate a smart contract with a request, and activate a reward payment upon receipt of a valid response.

### Making a request

After connecting your wallet to the Matrix: 

- Click on **Network Requests**
    - This will direct you to a dashboard which will contain current requests of the Matrix
- Click on **+Create Request**
    - Since you are using the Matrix for the first time, you will see a pop-up dialog with a `Setup Checklist` which includes:
    - `Eth in Wallet`
    - `XYO in Wallet`
    - `XYO Contract Authorization`
Above the checklist you should see a **Note** which tells you that in order to create requests on the XYO Matrix you will need both Eth and XYO in your browser based wallet. 

**The Matrix will allow you to receive Eth and XYO from a Kovan faucet**

Now, you will need Eth, so click on `Request Eth`
- This will direct you to a Kovan Faucet, and you will need a GitHub account
- Copy the first address from your MetaMask wallet and paste that into the account field in the Kovan Wallet
- Click on `Send me KETH!`
- The transaction will take you a few moments
- **Note** you can only get Eth from this faucet once every 24 hours

- If you have not received XYO Tokens in the last **2 hours** you will receive **2000** XYO Tokens
  - **Note** if you have received XYO tokens within 2 hours of your request, you will not receive any more tokens until **2 hours** from your last request. 
- **2000** XYO should be more than sufficient to get you going on using the Matrix, as each request will cost **500** XYO
- When you click the **Get XYO** button you will receive confirmation of a successful transaction
- You will notice that the available XYO and ETH have been updated
- You now have the funds needed to make a request.

- When you click on **+Create Request** again, you will now see a modal pop up:

### Submitting a Response



**You have just executed one of the core essentials of the XYO Network and the Matrix, celebrate by going to our [Bridge X Guide]() and set up your bridge to gather and transmit key heuristics, and if you really want to dive deep, go to our [Developer Portal]()

## Congratulations you have continued your journey into XYO and the Matrix!
