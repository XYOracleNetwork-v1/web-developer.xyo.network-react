# Welcome to the Next Stage in the Geomining Revolution
<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix" src="/docs/assets/matrix_horizontal.svg">
</h1>
**XYO** Is excited to announce two new products that will allow you to fully immerse yourself in the XYO network and become fully participatory in the process of Geomining and of ensuring strong location data certainty across many use cases and applications. 

Our **new XYO App** allows you to easily connect to both the new Sentinel X and the Bridge X to accelerate your geomining workflow. The interface is easy to use and it is a great tool to monitor number of Bound Witnesses, connect devices to the Xyo network and access tutorials on your devices.

We are also thrilled to introduce you to The **Matrix**, a new member of the XYO family which allows you to easily connect to a diviner. The **Matrix** is also a visual tool of the XYO network, where you can see activity in real time. The geomining revolution continues!

## Tools for Sentinels, Bridges, and Archivists

## Using the App
**The New XYO App allows you to interact with the XYO network's Sentinels and Bridges. In order to start interacting with the App you will need a few tools**

## Connecting your Bridge X with a browser

**The XYO Bridge is the primary data relayer of the XYO Network. It signs off on collected data from nearby Sentinel X devices to add to the proof of origin chain.**

### Getting Started

### What will you need? Some of these items you may not need but you should have just in case. 

- Bridge X device
- [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox Browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
- Access to router and router information 
- Ethernet cable
- HDMI Cable 

## Key Concepts you should review before diving into set up with the App

We recommend that you review these items prior to starting, but if you are too excited to get right in, go ahead and continue and these resources will be here when and if you need to dig deeper into a key word or concept. 

- [Read this guide on the 4 Node Types of XYO](https://developers.xyo.network/docs/en/Introduction/)
- [Read on the concept of a smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Smart_contracts)

### Getting connected 

### Set up  

To start using the Bridge X, you will need the device, and as back up, an ethernet cable and/or an HDMI cable.

**Three Options to Connect Your Bridge X**

### First option

- Connect your Bridge X to a power source
- Connect your Bridge to your Router using an Ethernet Cable
- Check to see if indicator lights are green near the ethernet and power ports
- Using your computer, point your browser to **xyo.local**
- You should see your Bridge and its IP address information on the **xyo.local** site
- Once you see this and confirm, then go ahead and click on the **Connect** button to connect the Bridge to the XYO Network!

### Second Option (Using Google Chrome or Firefox)
- Connect your Bridge X to a power source
- Connect your Bridge to your Router using an Ethernet Cable
- Check to see if indicator lights are green near the ethernet and power ports
- Using your computer, point your browser to **app.xyo.network**
- In the main app dashboard, you will see a **Scan for Devices** button
- Click **Scan For Devices**
- The app will take a few moments in scanning for your Bridge X, you will see an indicator for progress
- Once the app discovers the Bridge, you can verify the name and IP address of your Bridge X
- Click **Connect**
- You are now connected to your Bridge X!

### Third Option
- Connect your Bridge X to a power source
- Connect your Bridge to your Router using an Ethernet Cable
- Check to see if indicator lights are green near the ethernet and power ports
- Connect your Bridge X to a display of your choice using an HDMI cable
- You should now see a UI on your display
- If you do see this, go ahead and enter the values that it prompts for
- These values are your wifi username and password

### Using the Matrix

- You should also check out the Matrix for more info on the Archivists and Diviners that are using the date that your Bridge X is relaying.

**You have just executed one of the core essentials of the XYO Network and the Matrix, celebrate by going to our [Matrix Guide]() to learn more about the Matrix and setting up your archivist to gather heuristics from your bridge, and if you really want to dive deep, go to our [Developer Portal]()

### Congratulations you have continued your journey into XYO and Bridge X!

## Tools for Diviners

## Using the Matrix

**Along with serving as a viewer as to the state of the XYO network, the New XYO Matrix allows you to interact with Archivists and Diviners. In order to start interacting with the Matrix you will need a few tools**

### Getting Started

### What will you need?  

- Your chosen MetaMask tool - MetaMask allows you to use Ethereum accounts to interact with dApps

  - [MetaMask - Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)
  - [MetaMask - Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/)
  - [MetaMask - Opera Add-on](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/metamask/)
  - [Metamask using the Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)
    - **note** Using the Brave Browser is similar to using the Google Chrome version
  - A [GitHub account](https://github.com)
    - **note** If you do not have one, you can sign up using the link above

- A Faucet with XYO tokens
- And the [XYO Matrix]()

## Key Concepts and notices you should review before diving into the Matrix

We recommend that you review these items prior to starting, but if you are too excited to get right in, go ahead and continue and these resources will be here when and if you need to dig deeper into a key word or concept. 

- [Read this guide on the 4 Node Types of XYO](https://developers.xyo.network/docs/en/Introduction/)
- [Read on the concept of a smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Smart_contracts)

**NOTE** This is a tool that is still in continuous development using Ethereum on a testnet, **there will be some latency in certain processes**, so please ensure that you reserve a fair amount of time without too much interruption for this setup and walkthrough. 

**NOTE** Also, all of the Eth and XYO that you will be using for this walkthrough does not have any value, this is utility currency that is being used to power your interactions with the Matrix and for setup for future mainnet events.

## Set up  

To start using the Matrix, you will need to set up your MetaMask for the accounts that you have that contain XYO.

If you do not currently have a wallet, click on the **CREATE A WALLET** in the **New to MetaMask?** screen

<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="metamask-intro" src="/docs/assets/new_to_metamask.png">
</h1>

If you clicked on one of the above MetaMask links, that should've started you on the installation and setup of your MetaMask, including your seed phrase (see below).

<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="backup-seed-phrase" src="/docs/assets/backup_phrase.png">
</h1>

You should now see your MetaMask info: 

<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="metamask-dashboard" src="/docs/assets/metamask_dashboard.png">
</h1>

**This Dashboard includes:** 
- Your primary account number 
- How much **eth** you have in the account 
  - This will vary depending on which network you are in - to use the Matrix in this Beta State, you will use the ***Kovan Test Network***
- Transaction History
- Deposit/Send buttons
- A Network Selector in the upper right hand side of the dashboard
  - Again, to use the Matrix in this state, you will need to select the ***Kovan Test Network***

### Connecting Your Wallet

- It's time to go into the Matrix

Once you have setup your MetaMask, point your browser to **matrix.xyo.network**

You should see a dashboard that looks like this: 

<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix-before-sign-in" src="/docs/assets/pre_connect_wallet.png">
</h1>

Click on **Connect Wallet** which is in the upper right hand corner of the Matrix

Your MetaMask will ask for confirmation before connecting your wallet to the Matrix

<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="metamask-connect-matrix" src="/docs/assets/metamask_connect_matrix.png">
</h1>

Click **CONNECT**

Once you click connect, you will be directed back into the Matrix Dashboard, now the **Connect Wallet** button should be replaced by your account address from MetaMask, along with a `0` balance for both **ETH** and **XYO**. The exmaple screenshot does have a balance, which we will get together 
<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix-dashboard" src="/docs/assets/main_dashboard_matrix.png">
</h1>

**Once you have MetaMask setup and have connected your wallet you will be able to go to `Network Requests`, then `create request`, which will prompt the Matrix to direct you to our Kovan faucet so you can receive XYO Tokens**

## Using the Request/Response Interface

The XYO Network runs on making requests and getting responses. This query/answer protocol is what fuels the conversations between XYO nodes, and what allows us to reach location data certainty.

Using the Matrix, we can initiate a smart contract with a request, and activate a reward payment upon receipt of a valid response.

### Making a request

After connecting your wallet to the Matrix: 

- Click on **Network Requests**
    - This will direct you to a dashboard which will contain current requests of the Matrix
- Click on **+Create Request**
    - Since you are using the Matrix for the first time, you will see a pop-up dialog with a `Setup Checklist` which includes:
    - `Eth in Wallet`
    - `XYO in Wallet`
    - `XYO Contract Authorization`
Above the checklist you should see a **Note** which tells you that in order to create requests on the XYO Matrix you will need both Eth and XYO in your browser based wallet. 

**The Matrix will allow you to receive Eth and XYO from a Kovan faucet**

Now, you will need Eth, so click on the **+** button next to **Eth in wallet**
- This will direct you to a Kovan Faucet, and you will need a GitHub account
- Copy the first address from your MetaMask wallet and paste that into the account field in the Kovan Wallet
- Click on `Send me KETH!`
- The transaction will take you a few moments
- **Note** you can only get Eth from this faucet once every 24 hours

Now, you will need XYO, so click on the **+** button next to **XYO in wallet**
- If you have not received XYO Tokens in the last **2 hours** you will receive **2000** XYO Tokens
  - **Note** if you have received XYO tokens within 2 hours of your request, you will not receive any more tokens until **2 hours** from your last request. 
- **2000** XYO should be more than sufficient to get you going on using the Matrix, as each request will cost **500** XYO
- After clicking on the checkbox, you will see a pop-up modal with your metamask transaction confirmation. 
    - MetaMask is asking you to confirm that you want to complete this transaction
    - Click on **CONFIRM**
- After a few moments, you should see a notification from Google Chrome that the MetaMask transaction is complete. It should be a number such as `1`
- You will notice that the available XYO has been updated to `2000 XYO`
- You now have the XYO needed to make a request.

For our final step you will need to authorize the Matrix to use our SCSC in order to execute request/response cycles
- Click on the **+** button next to **XYO Contract Authorization**
- When you click on this button, MetaMask will pop up with a notice that some of your test XYO and some kovan eth will be needed to approve this transaction. This is to cover gas. 
- Click on **CONFIRM** 
- Once you confirm, wait a few moments for the transaction to confirm, you should see a notification that the transaction is complete
- You will see all of the items with a green checkmark next to them
- Click the **Next** button to go make a request!

### Submitting a request

- Your modal will shift from **+Create Request** to **Make a Request**
<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix-request-modal" src="/docs/assets/request_modal.png">
</h1>
- This new modal has **Request Type** 
- At this time you can only select **Intersection**
- Once you select **Intersection** you will see two fields **Party 1** and **Party 2**
<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix-request-entry" src="/docs/assets/intersection_entry.png">
</h1>
- Enter some data
- Once you enter data you will see another MetaMask pop up to ask your confirm this contract interaction. Again this rate is small and covers gas fees
<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix-request-dashboard" src="/docs/assets/request_confirmation.png">
</h1>
- Click **CONFIRM** to confirm your request transaction
- Similar to the other confirmations from MetaMask, you will see a notification that the transaction is confirmed
- After confirmation you will see your request updated on the **requests view**
<h1 align="left">
  <img alt="matrix-request-dashboard" src="/docs/assets/matrix_dashboard.png">
</h1>
    - The information on featured in this view is your block with:
        - Address of requester (that's you and your wallet address)
        - Answer - which will be unfulfilled until a response
        - Type of transaction (which will be an intersection as mentioned earlier in the guide)
        - XYO Bounty - the reward to the responder - this comes from your XYO balance

**You have just executed one of the core essentials of the XYO Network and the Matrix, celebrate by going to our [Bridge X Guide]() and set up your bridge to gather and transmit key heuristics, and if you really want to dive deep, go to our [Developer Portal]()

## Congratulations you have continued your journey into XYO and the Matrix!
