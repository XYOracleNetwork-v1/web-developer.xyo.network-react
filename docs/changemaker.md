      UC San Diego Challenge Concept Brief

  </a>

  Please take the time to go over the Challenge Concept Brief provided by UC San Diego. It contains an overview of the challenge's purpose, description of expected scope and scale, and articles on contact tracing ranging from what it is privacy, security, and ethical arguments. 

### Security and Privacy

Privacy and security for any contact tracing or wellness solution is a vital process that must be considered when architecting your solution.

### Rewards and Incentives

Whether it is contact tracing, testing, and/or other processes that involve human participation, there may be a divide as to whether to participate in any system to track Covid-19. With uncertainty, misinformation, and other factors affecting human behavior, encouraging participation in a contact tracing solution is 

### Proximity/Distance

Distance between someone who is infected to healthy people is vital to any solution. Social distancing measures during this pandemic and in pandemics of the past was an important factor in flattening and eliminating infection curve. This definitely should play a part in your solution. Think about how close someone could be to be infected from someone. 

### Resolution on Contact

Once there has been contact. What is the resolution? What should be done? What data should be reported if any, and to whom? Should the resolution remain in a ping on a map. What are the implications of data sharing in this manner. This would be another consideration. 

As with any solution regarding a sensitive health issue, there are many factors to consider. We strongly recommmend not abandoning these higher level concepts for the sake of code completion or a quicker MVP. Take the time to consider what your solution intends to do.
