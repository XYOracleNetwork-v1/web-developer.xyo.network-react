The Sentinel X is used in confirming location and users are actually getting paid for their data\n2. When combined with visual interfaces users are able to see their relative location on a 2 dimensional plane. This brings a \"realness\" to the Bound Witnesses\n3. COIN users are able to trustlessly confirm proximity to their Sentinel X and are able to do bound witnesses with the device. Users must receive a bonus of some sort to make this a 5 Star Product\n4. Sentinel X must be configured in such a way that batteries must last at least 6 months\n5. Return rates for Sentinel X must be below 5%\n6. Sentinel X Packaging must be 5 Star Quality and convey opportunity to contribute important \"World Problem Solving Data\" as well as an opportunity to make XYO\n7. Marketing the Sentinel X needs to convey the same message of contribute important \"World Problem Solving Data\" as well as an opportunity to make XYO",

This includes location data, audio data, temperature, video and more.\n\nThe XYO Network has four primary components, Sentinels, Bridges, Archivists, and Diviners. These four components enable  trustless verification of data. The XY Oracle Network allows users to write a smart contract that can be triggered by the interaction between two devices, allowing certainty that the devices were in fact in the same location at the same time. This is all done without risk of spoofing the location signaling device(s) verified by thousands of Sentinels in the XY Oracle Network.",

It will initially be focused on XYO and work only for those in range of Geomining Kit components, but eventually will work for any cryptocurrency or token and be available to any users.\n\nPurpose:\nThe initial purpose of Coin is to allow Geomining Kit owners to mine XYO with their edge nodes in the simplest way possible. All the end user will need to do is turn on their devices, install and open the app, and press “MINE” to start earning XYO. In the first version only users with edge nodes in range will be able to mine available Deposits. Also, to keep it simple, the XYO will be represented in the app but not actually owned by the user until it is withdrawn. The withdrawal process will simply be the users requesting a withdrawal, which meets a predefined threshold, and our support team manually transferring the XYO to their wallet (subtracting the amount of XYO equal to the ETH required to do the transaction).",
